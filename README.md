Alien game for CS141: Intro to Prog. and Prob Solving

Our goal was to code in an object-oriented format a video game designed by J. Hacker. There is an Alien
class to represent a monster and an AlienPack class that represents a band of aliens and how much damage they can inflict.

This was one of my first projects for my introductory Java class.
I was introduced to the following concepts:

* Overloading and overriding
* Object-oriented design
* Abstract classes and methods
